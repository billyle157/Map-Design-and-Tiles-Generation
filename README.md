# Map-Design-and-Tiles-Generation
Lab 4 for Geography 358

In this lab, I checked out the Raster Data for parks within the major Seattle area with available zoom levels 3-14. Map 1 displayed the monochrome basemap that will be used to combine with my thematic map data. For the thematic map data (map 2), I used the parks raster data in the Seattle area, and used that for map 3 combined with my monochrome basemap layer. Lastly, I wanted to make a map that represented a holiday coming up, which is the Lunar New Year, and created a gold and red theme map to display it.

I used AI in this assignment for debugging only. 
* Checked if my code was opening up all of the correct files/if files for png was correct.
